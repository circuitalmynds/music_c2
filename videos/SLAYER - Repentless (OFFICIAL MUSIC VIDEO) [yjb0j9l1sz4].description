This is McDonnell's first stint directing a music video. He directed the 2013 horror film Hatchet III, and his rich resume as a motion picture cameraman includes Avengers: Age Of Ultron, Ant-Man and The Interview. For SLAYER's "Repentless," he and the video's producer Felissa Rose pulled together a gang of actors and crew who have been part of some of the most iconic horror films ever made: Derek Mears (Predators, Friday The 13th, Tyler Mane (Halloween), Jason Trost (Hatchet III), Danny Trejo (Machete, From Dusk Till Dawn), Tony Moran (Halloween's Michael Myers, American Poltergeist), Sean Whalen (Men In Black, Halloween II), and Vernon Wells (Mad Max 2, Commando, Weird Science) all are featured inmates in the video. And if that wasn't enough, McDonnell and Rose brought in stunt coordinator Nils Allen Stewart who is known for his work on films like Planet Of The Apes, Anger Management and Daredevil.
